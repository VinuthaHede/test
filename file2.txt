Linux (/ˈlɪnʊks/ LIN-uuks)[11] is a family of open-source Unix-like 
operating systems based on the Linux kernel,[12] an operating 
system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus 
Torvalds.[13][14][15] Linux is typically packaged as a Linux 
distribution (distro), which includes the kernel and supporting 
system software and libraries, many of which are provided by
 the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" 
in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses and 
recommends the name "GNU/Linux" to emphasize the use and importance
 of GNU software in many distributions, causing some controversy.[16][17]

Popular Linux distributions[18][19][20] include Debian, 
Fedora Linux, Arch Linux, and Ubuntu. Commercial distributions
 include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise.
 Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such
 as X11 or Wayland and a desktop environment such as GNOME or
 KDE Plasma. Distributions intended for servers may not have a graphical 
user interface at all, or include a solution stack such as LAMP.Because Linux is freely 
redistributable, anyone may create a distribution for any purpose.[21
Linux was originally developed for personal computers based 
on the Intel x86 architecture, but has since been ported to 
more platforms than any other operating system.
